This model will be some kind of regression (and/or zeroth order estimate (probably for evaluation of model performance))
Based on data from 2025-01-19

It takes (for ships that will cross Oresund):
Distance to bridge (as calculated)
Speed of approach to bridge (as calculated from distance)

And predicts:
Time for crossing

There is then no ID and no history (except for calculating speed of approach)

Results from making_dataset (also first zeroth order model):
The 0th order estimate is alright but has serious outliers for "weird" boats.
It doesn't readily solve the issue of filtering out small boats
I will try some other model. 

Is it at all possible to create a classifier???
approximately 80 % of ships do not cross Oresund!



NEXT:
See how the zeroth order model will "perform" in real time!
Only showing ships moving TOWARDS broen
Showing estimates of TTC (and possibly error for illustration)
Then the human eye must be the classifier
Showing all ships inside some threshold (to be determined) and hiding ships moving away outside the corridor
Maybe, it is possible to define "cones of interest" to hide more ships (angle depending on distance from bridge)

This will show if classification is very important for the visual presentation or if precise regression is more important
(this will determine how to make the model!!!)
Is the real time picture very cluttered?
