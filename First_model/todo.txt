This model will be some kind of regression (and/or zeroth order estimate (probably for evaluation of model performance))
Based on data from 2025-01-19

It takes (for ships that will cross Oresund):
Distance to bridge (as calculated)
Speed of approach to bridge (as calculated from distance)

And predicts:
Time for crossing

There is then no ID and no history (except for calculating speed of approach)
