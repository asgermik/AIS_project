Next up is machine learning I think. Or some other more sophisticated mathematical model of the ship traffic. Idk what
But I will require much more data!
So now I will be working on scraping the site and automatically make the Oreswund cropping, filter and aggregate the data with relevant information

line 1:
1) ENFORCE DATATYPES IN LOADING!!!
2) Ensure that ship concatenation works!


line 2:
is there a more sensible distance metric than the simple signed one? one that can more elegantly take care of Copenhagen harbour?
is there a simple way to aggregate data with timeseries data? E.g. a statistical measure of "stillness"
